# Converted Events

Here is the list of the Task Router's events and their representation as teravoz events:

## Task events
* task.created -> **call.new**
* task.canceled -> **call.queue-abandon**
* task.wrapup -> **call.finished** AND **agent.left**

## Task Queue Events
* task-queue.entered -> **call.waiting**

## Reservation Events
* reservation.accepted -> **actor.entered** AND **call.ongoing**
* reservation.rejected -> **actor.noanswer**
* reservation.created -> **actor.ringing**

## Worker Events
*  worker.activity.update -> varies considering the WorkerActivityName:
* * If the WorkerActivityName is equal to `available` and he was not already available on the queue, then an **actor.logged-in** event is produced
* * If the WorkerActivityName is equal to `unavailable` or `offline`, while the agent was already not in these two status, then an **actor.logged-out** is produced
* * If the WorkerActivityName is equal to `break`, and the user was not already in the `break` status, then an **actor.paused** is produced
* * At least, if the WorkerActivityName is equal to available and the agent was in a break, then an **actor.unpaused** is produced.

# Converted Inputs
The user inputs events are generated by custom Twilio's function and are not received by POSTing the `/webhook` endpoint. Instead, the input data will be received on the `/input` route, and will also convert the received input to Teravoz's events. As these events aren't officialy emitted by task-router, they're fully customizable their names can be changed. By default, only the NPS input gathered by user is converted:

* custom.nps-provided -> **call.data-provided**, with the fields `data` and `nps` filled with the user evaluation of the call.


# Points to Review

* When the Task enters in the wrapup state (task.wrapup event), two Teravoz's events are fired: `call.finished` AND `agent.left`. However, maybe the actor.left event should be fired when the task finishes (task.completed event), because only on the end of the wrapup status the agent will be available again. 

* When a `actor.noanswer` is produced, the `ringtime` is equals to the task age on Twilio's Task Router, not the time that was ringing to the extension that have rejected or not answered the call.

* Verify where to emit the `peer.ringing` Teravoz event and what is the difference between it and the `actor.ringing` event.

# Missing fields

## General

* **code** - This field is intended to be provided by user when triggering the dialer, to recognize an specific call in the events.

## call.new

* **their_number_type** - This info is not provided when the taskRouter callback is triggered on task.new

## actor.* events

* **queue** - The change of status using the TaskRouter is not related to a queue, so this parameter is not provided by Twilio.
